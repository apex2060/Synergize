If they are not, we will run out of places to hold shoe drives long before we make enough money.
If one shoe drive takes such a large portion of Idaho, these will not be sustaining.
--If However, we maxamize these drives to produce enough with one or two stakes, we will be able to achieve success.

Every step is a chance to fall!
Though negative the thought may seem, the perspective it brings is critical to success.

Every interaction is intended to help them to progress.
Every push to progress causes them to evaluate the work, risk, and reward.
Every time they evaluate, they will have to make a decision to accept or reject.

The calls have been made.
The contacts are established.
The instructions still need to be given.

They need to begin!
...All our contacts are Student Council Advisors (teachers).  How will the
student council contribute?  How will they be involved?  What is their role?
Who needs to be contacted?  What information do they need to know?
What information do they need to relay?  To whom do they need to relay?
In what form do they need to relay?

We have been working diligently to organize this service project for the school.
At the end of this month we will be going to Burkina Faso Africa to put a well
in one of the most poor countries in the world.  A videographer has volunteered 
to go with us to create a story and report our work.  We are excited to share
this with you and your school in gratitude for making this well possible.


We have put together an amazingly simple, extremily important service project
for the school.  We are working to put a well in Africa.  To raise enough 
money for the well, we need to collect thousands of shoes.  We need your help
and quick!  I know organizing projects can be difficult and time-consuming.
We need you to be successful, more, the people in Burkina Faso need you to be
successful.  To make this project a success, we have put together a guide
to help make this painless and effective.  This guide will help you get the 
students involved and excited about the project.
